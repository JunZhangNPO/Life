# Relatedness Matters  
- Feb.1st, 2025

After skiing, I searched for an NGO related to skiing. I found one that focuses on enabling disabled people to enjoy sports, such as skiing.  
The organization's name is the **National Sports Center for the Disabled**.  

I read information on their website and also watched YouTube videos. I reacalled how much happiness skiing brings me and how it empowers me.  
I can imagine how happy people would be when they have the opportunity to ski.  

This connection convinced me of the organization's mission, and I decided to donate to them monthly.  
Relatedness plays a crucial role in donation behavior. Previously, a charitable program in China gained popularityâ€”it encouraged people to donate to individuals born on the same day as them.  
This **"same birthday"** idea instantly created a connection between two strangers.  

For **practice**, it is important to find the **relatedness** between donors and beneficiaries.  
For **research**, we can test how demonstrating relatedness influences participants' donation behavior.
